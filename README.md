The best way to handle your issues is write them down and realize the backlog (of your emotions) is never as intimidating as you think. I used to have a coworker that put everything down on lined yellow legal pads. I would have done that, but I wasn't sure it would be agile or cross-functional enough for a personal todo list. What's actually really good for agile is Node so I built this small app, for that. A window onto my very existence.
