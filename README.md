### What is this place??

The best way to handle your issues is to write them down and realize the backlog (of your glass case of emotion) is never as intimidating as you think. I used to have a coworker that put everything down on lined yellow legal pads. I would have done that, but I wasn't sure it would be agile or cross-functional enough for a personal todo list. What's actually really good for agile is Node so I built this small app, for that. A window onto my very existence.

_i-have-issues_ is part of my new side hustle ecosystem (see where it all began [here](https://medium.com/@internetross/my-first-side-hustle-project-for-no-money-but-skills-building-and-excuse-to-medium-a-goodreads-577244629208)) where I wrote code that solves already solved problems but I get to learn new things so I can maybe help solve less solved or unsolved problems in the future.
