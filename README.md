### What is this place??

The best way to handle your issues is write them down and realize the backlog (of your emotions) is never as intimidating as you think. I used to have a coworker that put everything down on lined yellow legal pads. I would have done that, but I wasn't sure it would be agile or cross-functional enough for a personal todo list. What's actually really good for agile is Node so I built this small app, for that. A window onto my very existence.

_i-have-issues_ is part of my new side hustle ecosystem (see where it all began [here](https://medium.com/@internetross/my-first-side-hustle-project-for-no-money-but-skills-building-and-excuse-to-medium-a-goodreads-577244629208)) where I wrote code that solves already solved problems but I get to learn new things so I can maybe help solve less solved or unsolved problems in the future.
